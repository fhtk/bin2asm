NOTES:

1. Unlike in the old Python implementation, bin2asm no longer attempts to
   crudely ‘guess’ symbols from the filename when provded. As a result, the
   -s flag is now mandatory for valid use.
2. This rewrite brings support for .size directives, so now ofiles will show
   the sizes occupied by symbols. This may be useful for heuristics.
